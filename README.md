## Description

Cambrian-yocto is a parent repository which allows for checking out, configuring and building a Yocto-derived Linux image for Cambrian Works hardware products suitable to use as a target for Cambrian Works applications.

## License

This software is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE.md).

## Supported platforms

Supported hardware target platforms are:

* The Cambrian Works GigRouter.

---

## Setup and build
### Automated script

Executing the `build.sh` script will automatically checkout the artifacts required to setup a build environment and produce an image. Usage is:

```
./build.sh gigrouter
```

Replacing the `gigrouter` argument with `clean` will delete all checked out repositories and build artifacts.

### Manual procedure

Alternatively, a build can be produced manually with the following steps:

1. Setup environment.

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Checkout meta layers.

```
kas checkout
```

3. Build image.

```
kas-container build
```

4. Opening a shell (for example, using bitbake to build a specific package).

```
kas-container shell kas/gigrouter-kas-config.yml
bitbake -c build tegra-binaries
```

5. Using shell commands as argument.

```
kas-container shell kas/gigrouter-kas-config.yml -c "bitbake -c cleansstate tegra-binaries"
```

## Flashing

The output image is found within the `build` directory under: `./build/tmp/deploy/images/gigrouter/cambrian-image-gigrouter.rootfs-[timestamp].tegraflash.tar.gz`

1. Extract to a host machine connected to the target hardware.

2. Power on the target hardware in *Recovery Mode*. When the target is in recovery mode the result of `lsusb` will include:

```
Bus 003 Device 022: ID 0955:7523 NVIDIA Corp. APX
```

3. Initiate flashing by executing the `doflash.sh` script generated by the build process included in the image archive:

```
sudo ./doflash.sh
```
