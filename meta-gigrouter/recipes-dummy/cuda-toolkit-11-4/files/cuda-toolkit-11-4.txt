cuda-toolkit-11-4 is a dependency packge of other software. However, in Yocto/meta-tegra CUDA tookit is provided by a generic package name "cuda-toolkit", rather than indicating the version number through the pakage name, and the versioning it maintained by the meta-tegra layer at build time. This dummy package exists to satisfy the package dependency, provided the cuda-toolkit package is also included in the build to provide the requisite dependencies.
